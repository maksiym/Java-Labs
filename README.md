#Java Lab 2:

->Implement the hierarchy of classes representing woodworking machines

->Carry out a search for machines by the name of the manufacturer and their purpose (woodworking, sawing, reymus, etc.)

->Implement the possibility of sorting machines by the volume of forest that can process the machine per hour (in m3) and their purpose (two separate methods)

->The implementation of sorting should provide the ability to sort both in descending and ascending order

->When writing a program, you need to use the arrangements for the design of the java code convention.

->Classes need to be properly divided into packages.

->Working with the console or console menu should be minimal.

->Important: only the class hierarchy needs to be implemented, the search code for items in lists or collections is not included in the 2nd work

->You should also create objects of the classes you have implemented in a separate Main class, which will contain the main method

#Java Lab 3:

->Add the implementation of methods lab2

#Java Lab 4:
 
->Turn lab2-3 into a maven project

#Java Lab 5:

->Write modular tests for lab4

#Java Lab 6:

->Implement code entry in a CSV file and verify code with checkstyle plugins and spotbugs and write tests
